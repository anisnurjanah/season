            The mood of rage is a strong and intense emotion characterized by a
            feeling of intense anger, fury, and indignation. It is often
            triggered by a sense of injustice or violation, and can result in
            aggressive or violent behavior if not properly controlled. The
            physical symptoms of rage can include rapid heartbeat, elevated
            blood pressure, and increased adrenaline levels, leading to a
            heightened state of arousal and readiness for action. Individuals
            experiencing rage may feel a strong urge to lash out and seek
            revenge, and may experience a sense of power and control when doing
            so. However, this can often lead to negative consequences and
            regret. It is important to learn healthy ways to manage and express
            feelings of rage, such as through exercise, deep breathing, or
            talking to a trusted friend or therapist.

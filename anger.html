            The mood of anger is an emotional state characterized by feelings of
            hostility, irritation, frustration, or rage. It is often accompanied
            by physiological responses such as increased heart rate, rapid
            breathing, and muscle tension. Anger can be a normal and healthy
            response to certain situations, such as when we feel our rights have
            been violated or when we need to set boundaries. However, when anger
            is chronic or expressed in unhealthy ways, it can lead to negative
            consequences in personal relationships, work environments, and
            overall mental and physical health.

            Anger is an intense emotional state characterized by strong feelings
            of annoyance, displeasure, and hostility, usually resulting from a
            perceived threat, injustice, or frustration. It is a powerful mood
            that can lead to various physical and psychological reactions, such
            as increased heart rate, high blood pressure, sweating, tense
            muscles, and aggressive behavior. Anger can also manifest in various
            degrees of severity, ranging from mild irritation to explosive rage.
            It is a normal and natural emotion, but when it becomes frequent,
            intense, or uncontrollable, it can negatively impact one's
            relationships, work performance, and overall well-being. Therefore,
            it is important to recognize and manage anger in a healthy way, such
            as through effective communication, relaxation techniques, and
            seeking professional help if necessary.
